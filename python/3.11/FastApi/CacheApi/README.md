# Python/FastAPI Tutorial for Visual Studio Code
This sample contains the completed program from the tutorial: [FastAPI in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-fastapi). Immediate steps are not included. 

## Run the app using GitHub Codespaces
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) provides cloud-powered development environments that work how and where you want it to. To learn how to set up a GitHub Codespace for this repository, check the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).

Once you open this repository in GitHub Codespaces, you can press **F5** to start the debugger and run the application.  

Once it's ready, you will see a notification with a button `Open in the Browser`. Clicking the button will open your application on the browser. You can then add `/docs` to the end of the URL to access the Swagger UI and interact with the application!
